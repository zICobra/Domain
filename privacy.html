  <h1>Privacy Policy for Deadzone</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01.01.2025</p>

  <p>
    Deadzone is developed by zICobra as a student project. This document explains my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you play my game.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone does not directly collect or store personal information. However, the game uses third-party services to provide online functionality, such as player authentication and multiplayer features. These services may collect information such as:
  </p>
  <p>- Player account details (e.g., linked platform accounts).</p>
  <p>- IP addresses and device-related information.</p>
  <p>- Gameplay session data (e.g., matchmaking or connectivity).</p>
  <p>
    This information is collected and handled by the third-party services as outlined in their respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone integrates Epic Online Services (EOS Plus Plugin) to provide account linking, multiplayer features, and authentication through supported platforms. Epic Games handles all user data related to these functionalities. This may include connections made through platforms such as PC game stores, console accounts, and other services supported by EOS.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you connect to Deadzone through a third-party platform, such as Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation, these platforms may collect and use data according to their own privacy policies. I encourage you to review the privacy policies of any platform you use to access the game.
  </p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    While I do not collect log data myself, third-party services may collect log information such as:
  </p>
  <p>- Your device's IP address.</p>
  <p>- Device type and operating system.</p>
  <p>- The version of the game you are using.</p>
  <p>
    This data is used to provide services like matchmaking, account authentication, and connectivity troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    My game itself does not use cookies. However, third-party services integrated into the game may use cookies to enhance the user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    I value your trust and strive to use only trusted third-party services that prioritize data security. Please note that no method of internet transmission is completely secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Epic Online Services, as the data handler, manages children’s privacy in compliance with applicable regulations. For more information, please refer to their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Effective Date."
  </p>
