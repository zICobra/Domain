  <h1>Privacy Policy for Deadzone</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01.01.2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone is developed by zICobra as a student project. This Privacy Policy outlines my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you play my game. Deadzone prioritizes your privacy, and any data collected is handled by trusted third-party services for functionality purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone itself does not directly collect or store personal information. However, third-party services used in the game may gather certain types of information to enable online features. This data may include:
  </p>
  <p>
    - Player account details, such as linked platform accounts. <br>
    - IP addresses and device-related information. <br>
    - Gameplay session data, including matchmaking and connectivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data collected is handled by the respective third-party services, and their privacy policies apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone integrates Epic Online Services (EOS Plus Plugin) to provide essential features like account linking, multiplayer functionality, and authentication across supported platforms. These services are managed by Epic Games, which handles all user data related to these functionalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, if you connect to Deadzone through third-party platforms like Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation, those platforms may collect and manage data according to their own privacy policies. Please review the relevant policies for more information.
  </p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    While I do not collect log data directly, the third-party services integrated into the game may log information for troubleshooting and service improvement. This information may include:
  </p>
  <p>
    - Your device’s IP address. <br>
    - Device type and operating system. <br>
    - The version of the game you are playing.
  </p>
  <p>
    These logs help to support services like matchmaking, account authentication, and resolving connectivity issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone itself does not use cookies. However, cookies may be utilized by the third-party services integrated into the game to enhance user experience and functionality. Please consult the privacy policies of those services for more details.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    I value your trust and work only with reputable third-party services that emphasize security in their data-handling practices. However, please note that no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Deadzone does not directly manage user data. Epic Online Services, as the primary data handler, ensures compliance with applicable regulations regarding children’s privacy. For additional details, please refer to the Epic Games Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be updated accordingly. I encourage you to review the policy periodically for any updates.
  </p>
